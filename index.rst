Aspects of the Abstract Submission Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1.	Call for submissions – Abstracts are submitted
  2.	Grading of Abstracts – Completed submissions are graded by grading committees
  3.	Acceptance – If the grading committee accepts the submission for presentation, the submitter has the opportunity to accept it
  4.	Revision – Submitters can revise their previously submitted abstract
  5.	An accepted submission can be scheduled for presentation at the society’s meeting. In many cases, they use the scheduling component of the software.
